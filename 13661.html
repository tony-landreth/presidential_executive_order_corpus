Accordingly, I hereby order:</p>

            <strong>Section 1.</strong> (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person (including any foreign branch) of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:</p>

            <strong>Sec. 2.</strong> I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="15536"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-15536" data-page="15536" data-text="Start Printed Page 15536" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 15536}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 15536</span></span></span>States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons.

          <p id="p-16" data-page="15536">
            <strong>Sec. 3.</strong> I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13660">Executive Order 13660,</a> and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-17" data-page="15536">
            <strong>Sec. 4.</strong> The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not limited to:</p>
          <p id="p-18" data-page="15536">(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</p>
          <p id="p-19" data-page="15536">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>

            <strong>Sec. 5.</strong> (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-21" data-page="15536">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>

          <p id="p-26" data-page="15536">(d) the term the “Government of the Russian Federation” means the Government of the Russian Federation, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of the Government of the Russian Federation, and any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of the Russian Federation.</p>
          <p id="p-27" data-page="15536">
            <strong>Sec. 7.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13660">Executive Order 13660,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>

The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
