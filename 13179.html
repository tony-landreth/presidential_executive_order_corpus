          <h1 id="h-1">Providing Compensation to America's Nuclear Weapons Workers</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="77487">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including <a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=106&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=398&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 106-398</a>, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (<a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=106&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=398&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 106-398</a>, the “Act”), and to allocate the responsibilities imposed by that legislation and to provide for further legislative efforts, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="77487">
            <strong>Section 1.</strong>
            <em> Policy.</em> Since World War II, hundreds of thousands of men and women have served their Nation in building its nuclear defense. In the course of their work, they overcame previously unimagined scientific and technical challenges. Thousands of these courageous Americans, however, paid a high price for their service, developing disabling or fatal illnesses as a result of exposure to beryllium, ionizing radiation, and other hazards unique to nuclear weapons production and testing. Too often, these workers were neither adequately protected from, nor informed of, the occupational hazards to which they were exposed.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="77487">Existing workers' compensation programs have failed to provide for the needs of these workers and their families. Federal workers' compensation programs have generally not included these workers. Further, because of long latency periods, the uniqueness of the hazards to which they were exposed, and inadequate exposure data, many of these individuals have been unable to obtain State workers' compensation benefits. This problem has been exacerbated by the past policy of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessors of encouraging and assisting DOE contractors in opposing the claims of workers who sought those benefits. This policy has recently been reversed.</p>

          <p id="p-4" data-page="77487">While the Nation can never fully repay these workers or their families, they deserve recognition and compensation for their sacrifices. Since the Administration's historic announcement in July of 1999 that it intended to compensate DOE nuclear weapons workers who suffered occupational illnesses as a result of exposure to the unique hazards in building the Nation's nuclear defense, it has been the policy of this Administration to support fair and timely compensation for these workers and their survivors. The Federal Government should provide necessary information and otherwise help employees of the DOE or its contractors determine if their illnesses are associated with conditions of their nuclear weapons-related work; it should provide workers and their survivors with all pertinent and available information necessary for evaluating and processing claims; and it should ensure that this program minimizes the administrative burden on workers and their survivors, and respects their dignity and privacy. This order sets out agency responsibilities to accomplish these goals, building on the Administration's articulated principles and the framework set forth in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Energy shall be responsible for developing and implementing actions under the Act to compensate these workers and their families in a manner that is compassionate, fair, and timely. Other Federal agencies, as appropriate, shall assist in this effort.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="77488"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-77488" data-page="77488" data-text="Start Printed Page 77488" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 77488}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 77488</span></span></span>
