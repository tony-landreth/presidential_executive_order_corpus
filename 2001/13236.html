          <p id="p-1" data-page="59671">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 292 of the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964, as amended (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=2141&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 2141</a>), and in order to conform the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="59671">
            <strong>Section 1.</strong> The Director of Central Intelligence may waive the application of the dual compensation reduction provisions of sections 271 and 273 of the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=2111&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 2111</a> and 2113) for an employee serving on a temporary basis, but only if, and for so long as, the authority is necessary due to an emergency involving a direct threat to life or property or other unusual circumstances.

This authority may be delegated as appropriate.</p>
