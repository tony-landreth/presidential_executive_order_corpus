        <h1 id="h-1">Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="20815">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=43&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1331&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">43 U.S.C. 1331</a> <em>et seq.,</em> and in order to maintain global leadership in energy innovation, exploration, and production, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="20815">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Findings.</em> America must put the energy needs of American families and businesses first and continue implementing a plan that ensures energy security and economic vitality for decades to come. The energy and minerals produced from lands and waters under Federal management are important to a vibrant economy and to our national security. Increased domestic energy production on Federal lands and waters strengthens the Nation's security and reduces reliance on imported energy. Moreover, low energy prices, driven by an increased American energy supply, will benefit American families and help reinvigorate American manufacturing and job growth. Finally, because the Department of Defense is one of the largest consumers of energy in the United States, domestic energy production also improves our Nation's military readiness.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="20815">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> It shall be the policy of the United States to encourage energy exploration and production, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to maintain the Nation's position as a global energy leader and foster energy security and resilience for the benefit of the American people, while ensuring that any such activity is safe and environmentally responsible.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="20815">
          <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. <em>Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy.</em> To carry out the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall:</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="20815">(a) as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, including the procedures set forth in section 1344 of title 43, United States Code, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, give full consideration to revising the schedule of proposed oil and gas lease sales, as described in that section, so that it includes, but is not limited to, annual lease sales, to the maximum extent permitted by law, in each of the following Outer Continental Shelf Planning Areas, as designated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) (Planning Areas): Western Gulf of Mexico, Central Gulf of Mexico, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Cook Inlet, Mid-Atlantic, and South Atlantic;</p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="20815">(b) ensure that any revisions made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section do not hinder or affect ongoing lease sales currently scheduled as part of the 2017-2022 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Proposed Final Program, as published on November 18, 2016; and</p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="20815">(c) develop and implement, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce and to the maximum extent permitted by law, a streamlined permitting approach for privately funded seismic data research and collection aimed at expeditiously determining the offshore energy resource potential of the United States within the Planning Areas.</p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="20815">
          <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. <em>Responsible Planning for Future Offshore Energy Potential.</em> (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall, unless expressly required otherwise, refrain from designating or expanding any National Marine Sanctuary under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=16&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1431&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">16 U.S.C. 1431</a> <em>et seq.,</em> unless the sanctuary designation or expansion proposal includes a timely, full accounting from the Department of the Interior of any energy or mineral resource potential <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="20816"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-20816" data-page="20816" data-text="Start Printed Page 20816" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 20816}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 20816</span></span></span>within the designated area—including offshore energy from wind, oil, natural gas, methane hydrates, and any other sources that the Secretary of Commerce deems appropriate—and the potential impact the proposed designation or expansion will have on the development of those resources. The Secretary of the Interior shall provide any such accounting within 60 days of receiving a notification of intent to propose any such National Marine Sanctuary designation or expansion from the Secretary of Commerce.</p>

        <p id="p-12" data-page="20816">(B) an analysis of the adequacy of any required Federal, State, and tribal consultations conducted before the designations or expansions; and</p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="20816">(C) the opportunity costs associated with potential energy and mineral exploration and production from the Outer Continental Shelf, in addition to any impacts on production in the adjacent region.</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-14" data-page="20816">(ii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Interior, shall report the results of the review under this subsection to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.</p>
