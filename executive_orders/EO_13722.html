          <p id="p-2" data-page="14943">I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the Government of North Korea's continuing pursuit of its nuclear and missile programs, as evidenced most recently by its February 7, 2016, launch using ballistic missile technology and its January 6, 2016, nuclear test in violation of its obligations pursuant to numerous UNSCRs and in contravention of its commitments under the September 19, 2005, Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, increasingly imperils the United States and its allies. To address those actions, and to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466</a> of June 26, 2008, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in subsequent Executive Orders, I hereby order:</p>

          <p id="p-16" data-page="14944">
            <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. (a) The following are prohibited:</p>

I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in subsection 2(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p>

          <p id="p-23" data-page="14945">
            <strong>Sec. 6</strong>. The prohibitions in sections 1 and 2 of this order include but are not limited to:</p>

          <p id="p-26" data-page="14945">
            <strong>Sec. 7</strong>. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-27" data-page="14945">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-28" data-page="14945">
            <strong>Sec. 8</strong>. Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government or the United Nations (including its specialized agencies, programmes, funds, and related organizations) by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.</p>
          <p id="p-29" data-page="14945">
            <strong>Sec. 9</strong>. For the purposes of this order:</p>
          <p id="p-30" data-page="14945">(a) the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means an individual or entity;</p>
          <p id="p-31" data-page="14945">(b) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>

          <p id="p-34" data-page="14945">
            <strong>Sec. 10</strong>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 or 2 of this order.</p>

            <strong>Sec. 11</strong>.

The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
