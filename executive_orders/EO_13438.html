          <p id="p-2" data-page="39719">I, GEORGE W.

          (i) to have committed, or to pose a significant risk of committing, an act or acts of violence that have the purpose or effect of:

            <strong>Sec. 2.</strong> (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="39720">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>

            <strong>Sec. 3.</strong> For purposes of this order:</p>
          <p id="p-13" data-page="39720">(a) the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means an individual or entity;</p>
          <p id="p-14" data-page="39720">(b) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and</p>

            <strong>Sec. 5.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that, because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13303">Executive Order 13303</a> and expanded in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13315">Executive Order 13315,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1(a) of this order. </p>

The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government, consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken.</p>
