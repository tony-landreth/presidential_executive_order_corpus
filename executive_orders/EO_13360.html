            <em> Policy.</em> America honors the extraordinary service rendered to the United States by veterans with disabilities incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during active service with the armed forces.

To achieve that objective, agencies shall more effectively implement section 15(g) of the Small Business Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=15&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=644&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">15 U.S.C. 644</a>(g)), which provides that the President must establish a goal of not less than 3 percent for participation by service-disabled veteran businesses in Federal contracting, and section 36 of that Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=15&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=657&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">15 U.S.C. 657</a>f), which gives agency contracting officers the authority to reserve certain procurements for service-disabled veteran businesses.</p>
