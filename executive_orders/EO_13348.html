          <h1 id="h-1">Blocking Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting the Importation of Certain Goods from Liberia</h1>

          <p id="p-1" data-page="44885">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1701&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq</em>.)

(NEA), section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act, as amended (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=22&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=287&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">22 U.S.C. 287</a>c) (UNPA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in view of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1521 of December 22, 2003, and 1532 of March 12, 2004,</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="44885">I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, note that the actions and policies of former Liberian President Charles Taylor and other persons, in particular their unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and their removal from Liberia and secreting of Liberian funds and property, have undermined Liberia's transition to democracy and the orderly development of its political, administrative, and economic institutions and resources. I further note that the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed on August 18, 2003, and the related ceasefire have not yet been universally implemented throughout Liberia, and that the illicit trade in round logs and timber products is linked to the proliferation of and trafficking in illegal arms, which perpetuate the Liberian conflict and fuel and exacerbate other conflicts throughout West Africa. I find that the actions, policies, and circumstances described above constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. To address that threat, I hereby order:</p>

            <strong>Section 1.</strong> (a) Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), (3), and (4) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(1), (3), and (4)), or regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, all property and interests in property of the following persons, that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States persons, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:</p>
          (i)
           the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and
          (ii)
           any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:
          (A)
           to be or have been an immediate family member of Charles Taylor;
          (B)
           to have been a senior official of the former Liberian regime headed by Charles Taylor or otherwise to have been or be a close ally or associate of Charles Taylor or the former Liberian regime;
          (C)

           to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, the unlawful depletion of Liberian resources, the removal of Liberian resources from that country, and the secreting of Liberian funds and property by any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="44886"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-44886" data-page="44886" data-text="Start Printed Page 44886" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 44886}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 44886</span></span></span>
          
          (D)
           to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.
          <p id="p-4" data-page="44886">(b) I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of, any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="44886">(c) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include, but are not limited to,</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="44886">(i) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of, any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order, and</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="44886">(ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="44886">
            <strong>Sec. 2.</strong> Except to the extent provided in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, the direct or indirect importation into the United States of any round log or timber product originating in Liberia is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-9" data-page="44886">
            <strong>Sec. 3.</strong> (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="44886">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="44886">
            <strong>Sec. 4.</strong> For purposes of this order: (a) the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means an individual or entity;</p>
          <p id="p-12" data-page="44886">(b) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>
          <p id="p-13" data-page="44886">(c) the term &ldquo;United States person&rdquo; means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; and</p>
          <p id="p-14" data-page="44886">(d) the term &ldquo;round log or timber product&rdquo; means any product classifiable in Chapter 44 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.</p>
          <p id="p-15" data-page="44886">
            <strong>Sec. 5.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>

The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government, consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="44887"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-44887" data-page="44887" data-text="Start Printed Page 44887" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 44887}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 44887</span></span></span>
