          <h1 id="h-1">Regulation and Independent Regulatory Agencies</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="41587">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to improve regulation and regulatory review, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="41587">
            <strong>Section 1.</strong>
            <em>Policy. </em> (a) Wise regulatory decisions depend on public participation and on careful analysis of the likely consequences of regulation. Such decisions are informed and improved by allowing interested members of the public to have a meaningful opportunity to participate in rulemaking. To the extent permitted by law, such decisions should be made only after consideration of their costs and benefits (both quantitative and qualitative).</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="41587">(b) <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13563">Executive Order 13563</a> of January 18, 2011, &ldquo;Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,&rdquo; directed to executive agencies, was meant to produce a regulatory system that protects &ldquo;public health, welfare, safety, and our environment while promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation.&rdquo;  Independent regulatory agencies, no less than executive agencies, should promote that goal.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="41587">(c) <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13563">Executive Order 13563</a> set out general requirements directed to executive agencies concerning public participation, integration and innovation, flexible approaches, and science. To the extent permitted by law, independent regulatory agencies should comply with these provisions as well.</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="41587">
            <strong>Sec. 2.</strong>
            <em>Retrospective Analyses of Existing Rules. </em> (a) To facilitate the periodic review of existing significant regulations, independent regulatory agencies should consider how best to promote retrospective analysis of rules that may be outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome, and to modify, streamline, expand, or repeal them in accordance with what has been learned. Such retrospective analyses, including supporting data and evaluations, should be released online whenever possible.</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="41587">(b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, each independent regulatory agency should develop and release to the public a plan, consistent with law and reflecting its resources and regulatory priorities and processes, under which the agency will periodically review its existing significant regulations to determine whether any such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed so as to make the agency's regulatory program more effective or less burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="41587">
            <strong>Sec. 3.</strong>
