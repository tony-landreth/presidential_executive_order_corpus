        <p id="p-14" data-page="52210">
          <strong>Sec. 4.</strong> The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not limited to:</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="52210">(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</p>

          <strong>Sec. 5.</strong> The prohibitions in sections 1 and 2 of this order apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="52210">
          <strong>Sec. 6.</strong> (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="52210">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 7.</strong> Nothing in sections 1 or 2 of this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 8.</strong> For the purposes of this order:</p>
        <p id="p-22" data-page="52210">(a) the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means an individual or entity;</p>

        <p id="p-26" data-page="52210">
          <strong>Sec. 9.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13338">Executive Order 13338</a> and expanded in scope in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13572">Executive Order 13572,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
