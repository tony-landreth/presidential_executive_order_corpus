        <p id="p-3" data-page="28711">(b) Each agency shall, by September 30, 2019, terminate at least one-third of its current committees established under section 9(a)(2) of FACA, including committees for which the:</p>

Such a waiver is in addition to the notice and other requirements of FACA and its implementing regulations.</p>
