          <p id="p-3" data-page="38843">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. (a) All property and interests in property of the Government of Venezuela that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in.</p>

            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1(b) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except when the Secretary of State determines that the person's entry would not be contrary to the interests of <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="38844"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-38844" data-page="38844" data-text="Start Printed Page 38844" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 38844}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 38844</span></span></span>the United States, including when the Secretary so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person's entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives. In exercising this responsibility, the Secretary of State shall consult the Secretary of Homeland Security on matters related to admissibility or inadmissibility within the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Such persons shall be treated in the same manner as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions). The Secretary of State shall have the responsibility for implementing this section pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Secretary has established or may establish pursuant to Proclamation 8693.</p>
          <p id="p-9" data-page="38844">
            <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include:</p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="38844">(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="38844">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>

          <p id="p-15" data-page="38844">(a) transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof; or</p>
          <p id="p-16" data-page="38844">(b) transactions related to the provision of articles such as food, clothing, and medicine intended to be used to relieve human suffering.</p>
          <p id="p-17" data-page="38844">
            <strong>Sec. 6</strong>. For the purposes of this order:</p>
          <p id="p-18" data-page="38844">(a) the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means an individual or entity;</p>
          <p id="p-19" data-page="38844">(b) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>

          <p id="p-22" data-page="38844">
            <strong>Sec. 7</strong>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13692">Executive Order 13692,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
