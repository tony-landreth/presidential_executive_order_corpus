        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13495">Executive Order 13495</a> of January 30, 2009
        <h1 id="h-1">Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="6103">When a service contract expires, and a follow-on contract is awarded for the same service, at the same location, the successor contractor or its subcontractors often hires the majority of the predecessor's employees.  On some occasions, however, a successor contractor or its subcontractors hires a new work force, thus displacing the predecessor's employees.</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="6103">The Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency are served when the successor contractor hires the predecessor's employees.  A carryover work force reduces disruption to the delivery of services during the period of transition between contractors and provides the Federal Government the benefits of an experienced and trained work force that is familiar with the Federal Government's personnel, facilities, and requirements.</p>

        <p id="p-3" data-page="6103">Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=40&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=101&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">40 U.S.C. 101</a> <em>et seq</em>., and in order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Government procurement, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="6103">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em>Policy. </em> It is the policy of the Federal Government that service contracts and solicitations for such contracts shall include a clause that requires the contractor, and its subcontractors, under a contract that succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services at the same location, to offer those employees (other than managerial and supervisory employees) employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified.  There shall be no employment openings under the contract until such right of first refusal has been provided.  Nothing in this order shall be construed to permit a contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive Order or law of the United States.</p>

        <p id="p-16" data-page="6104">&ldquo;NONDISPLACEMENT OF QUALIFIED WORKERS</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="6104">&ldquo;(a)  Consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, the contractor and its subcontractors shall, except as otherwise provided herein, in good faith offer those employees (other than managerial and supervisory employees) employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of award of this contract or the expiration of the contract under which the employees were hired, a right of first refusal of employment under this contract in positions for which employees are qualified.  The contractor and its subcontractors shall determine the number of employees necessary for efficient performance of this contract and may elect to employ fewer employees than the predecessor contractor employed in connection with performance of the work.  Except as provided in paragraph (b) there shall be no employment opening under this contract, and the contractor and any subcontractors shall not offer employment under this contract, to any person prior to having complied fully with this obligation.  The contractor and its subcontractors shall make an express offer of employment to each employee as provided herein and shall state the time within which the employee must accept such offer, but in no case shall the period within which the employee must accept the offer of employment be less than 10 days.</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="6104">&ldquo;(b)  Notwithstanding the obligation under paragraph (a) above, the contractor and any subcontractors (1) may employ under this contract any employee who has worked for the contractor or subcontractor for at least 3 months immediately preceding the commencement of this contract and who would otherwise face lay-off or discharge, (2) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor contractor who are not service employees within the meaning of the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=41&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=357&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">41 U.S.C. 357</a>(b), and (3) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor contractor whom the contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job.</p>

        <p id="p-19" data-page="6104">&ldquo;(c)  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.222-41(n), the contractor shall, not less than 10 days before completion of this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts during the last month of contract performance.

        <p id="p-21" data-page="6105">&ldquo;(e)  In every subcontract entered into in order to perform services under this contract, the contractor will include provisions that ensure that each subcontractor will honor the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (b) with respect to the employees of a predecessor subcontractor or subcontractors working under this contract, as well as of a predecessor contractor and its subcontractors.  The subcontract shall also include provisions to ensure that the subcontractor will provide the contractor with the information about the employees of the subcontractor needed by the contractor to comply with paragraph 5(c), above.  The contractor will take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-compliance:  provided, however, that if the contractor, as a result of such direction, becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, the contractor may request that the United States enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.&rdquo;</p>

          <strong>Sec. 6.</strong>
          <em>Enforcement. </em> (a)  The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) is responsible for investigating and obtaining compliance with this order.

Neither an order for debarment of any contractor or subcontractor from further Government contracts under this section nor the inclusion of a contractor or subcontractor on a published list of noncomplying contractors shall be carried out without affording the contractor or subcontractor an opportunity for a hearing.</p>

To the extent practicable, such regulations shall favor the resolution of disputes by efficient and informal alternative dispute resolution methods.  The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, issue regulations, within 180 days of the date of this order, to the extent permitted by law, to implement the requirements of this order.  The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall issue, within 180 days of the date of this order, to the extent permitted by law, regulations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation to provide for inclusion of the contract clause in Federal solicitations and contracts subject to this order.</p>
