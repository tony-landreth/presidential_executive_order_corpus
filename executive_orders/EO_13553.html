        <p id="p-3" data-page="60567">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong> (a)  All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, including any overseas branch, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:</p>
        (i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and
        (ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with or at the recommendation of the Secretary of State:
        <p id="p-6" data-page="60567">(A) to be an official of the Government of Iran or a person acting on behalf of the Government of Iran (including members of paramilitary organizations) who is responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission of serious human rights abuses against persons in Iran or Iranian citizens or residents, or the family members of the foregoing, on or after June 12, 2009, regardless of whether such abuses occurred in Iran;</p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="60567">(B) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, the activities described in subsection (a)(ii)(A) of this section or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or </p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="60567">(C) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order. </p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="60567">(b)  I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to subsection (a) of this section would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/12957">Executive Order 12957,</a> and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by subsection (a) of this section. </p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="60567">(c) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section include but are not limited to: </p>

        (i)  the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="60568"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-60568" data-page="60568" data-text="Start Printed Page 60568" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 60568}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 60568</span></span></span>

        <p id="p-13" data-page="60568">(d) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order. </p>
        <p id="p-14" data-page="60568">
          <strong>Sec. 2.</strong> (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. </p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="60568">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. </p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="60568">
          <strong>Sec. 3.</strong> For the purposes of this order: </p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="60568">(a) the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means an individual or entity; </p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="60568">(b) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; </p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="60568">(c) the term &ldquo;United States person&rdquo; means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; </p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="60568">(d) the term &ldquo;Government of Iran&rdquo; includes the Government of Iran, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, and any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran; and </p>
        <p id="p-21" data-page="60568">(e) the term &ldquo;family member&rdquo; means, with respect to an individual, a spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandchild, or grandparent of the individual. </p>
        <p id="p-22" data-page="60568">
          <strong>Sec. 4.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/12957">Executive Order 12957,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1(a) of this order. </p>
