        <p id="p-1" data-page="67249">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of Federal policies that have tribal implications, to strengthen the United States government-to-government relationships with Indian tribes, and to reduce the imposition of unfunded mandates upon Indian tribes; it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="67249">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em> Definitions.</em> For purposes of this order:</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="67249">(a) &ldquo;Policies that have tribal implications&rdquo; refers to regulations, legislative comments or proposed legislation, and other policy statements or actions that have substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="67249">(b) &ldquo;Indian tribe&rdquo; means an Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or community that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges to exist as an Indian tribe pursuant to the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=25&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=479&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">25 U.S.C. 479</a>a.</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="67249">(c) &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; means any authority of the United States that is an &ldquo;agency&rdquo; under <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=44&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=3502&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">44 U.S.C. 3502</a>(1), other than those considered to be independent regulatory agencies, as defined in <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=44&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=3502&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">44 U.S.C. 3502</a>(5).</p>

        <p id="p-7" data-page="67249">
          <strong>Sec. 2.</strong>
          <em> Fundamental Principles.</em> In formulating or implementing policies that have tribal implications, agencies shall be guided by the following fundamental principles:</p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="67249">(a) The United States has a unique legal relationship with Indian tribal governments as set forth in the Constitution of the United States, treaties, statutes, Executive Orders, and court decisions. Since the formation of the Union, the United States has recognized Indian tribes as domestic dependent nations under its protection. The Federal Government has enacted numerous statutes and promulgated numerous regulations that establish and define a trust relationship with Indian tribes.</p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="67249">(b) Our Nation, under the law of the United States, in accordance with treaties, statutes, Executive Orders, and judicial decisions, has recognized the right of Indian tribes to self-government. As domestic dependent nations, Indian tribes exercise inherent sovereign powers over their members and territory. The United States continues to work with Indian tribes on a government-to-government basis to address issues concerning Indian tribal self-government, tribal trust resources, and Indian tribal treaty and other rights.</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="67249">(c) The United States recognizes the right of Indian tribes to self-government and supports tribal sovereignty and self-determination.</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="67249">
          <strong>Sec. 3.</strong>
          <em> Policymaking Criteria.</em> In addition to adhering to the fundamental principles set forth in section 2, agencies shall adhere, to the extent permitted by law, to the following criteria when formulating and implementing policies that have tribal implications:<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="67250"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-67250" data-page="67250" data-text="Start Printed Page 67250" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 67250}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 67250</span></span></span>
        </p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="67250">(a) Agencies shall respect Indian tribal self-government and sovereignty, honor tribal treaty and other rights, and strive to meet the responsibilities that arise from the unique legal relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribal governments.</p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="67250">(b) With respect to Federal statutes and regulations administered by Indian tribal governments, the Federal Government shall grant Indian tribal governments the maximum administrative discretion possible.</p>

        <p id="p-17" data-page="67250">(3) in determining whether to establish Federal standards, consult with tribal officials as to the need for Federal standards and any alternatives that would limit the scope of Federal standards or otherwise preserve the prerogatives and authority of Indian tribes.</p>
