          <HD SOURCE="HED">Blocking Property and Suspending Entry of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Mali</HD>

          <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (NEA), the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 (22 U.S.C. 287c) (UNPA), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in view of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2374 of September 5, 2017, and UNSCR 2432 of August 30, 2018.</FP>
          <FP>I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the situation in Mali, including repeated violations of ceasefire arrangements made pursuant to the 2015 Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali; the expansion of terrorist activities into southern and central Mali; the intensification of drug trafficking and trafficking in persons, human rights abuses, and hostage-taking; and the intensification of attacks against civilians, the Malian defense and security forces, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilizations Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), and international security presences, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. I hereby order:</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Section 1</E>. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged in, any of the following in or in relation to Mali:</FP>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(A) actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Mali;</P>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(B) actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Mali;</P>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(C) a hostile act in violation of, or an act that obstructs, including by prolonged delay, or threatens the implementation of, the 2015 Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali;</P>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(D) planning, directing, sponsoring, or conducting attacks against local, regional, or state institutions, the Malian defense and security forces, any international security presences, MINUSMA peacekeepers, other United Nations or associated personnel, or any other peacekeeping operations;</P>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(E) obstructing the delivery or distribution of, or access to, humanitarian assistance;</P>

          <P SOURCE="P1">(F) planning, directing, or committing an act that violates international humanitarian law or that constitutes a serious human rights abuse or violation, including an act involving the targeting of civilians through <PRTPAGE P="37056"/>the commission of an act of violence, abduction or enforced disappearance, forced displacement, or an attack on a school, hospital, religious site, or location where civilians are seeking refuge;</P>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(G) the use or recruitment of children by armed groups or armed forces in the context of the armed conflict in Mali;</P>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(H) the illicit production or trafficking of narcotics or their precursors originating or transiting through Mali;</P>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(I) trafficking in persons, smuggling migrants, or trafficking or smuggling arms or illicitly acquired cultural property; or</P>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(J) any transaction or series of transactions involving bribery or other corruption, such as the misappropriation of Malian public assets or expropriation of private assets for personal gain or political purposes;</P>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.</FP>
          <P>(b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order.</P>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1 of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except where the Secretary of State determines that the person's entry is in the national interest of the United States, including when the Secretary so determines based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person's entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not limited to:</FP>
          <P>(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</P>
          <P>(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</P>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</FP>
          <P>(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</P>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 6</E>. For the purposes of this order:</FP>

          <P>(a) the term “person” means an individual or entity;<PRTPAGE P="37057"/>
          </P>
          <P>(b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and</P>
          <P>(c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.</P>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 7</E>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 8</E>. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including promulgating rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and the UNPA as may be necessary to implement this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All agencies of the United States Government shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 9</E>. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 40l(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 164l(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 10</E>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</FP>
          <P>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</P>
          
          <PRTPAGE P="37058"/>
          <P>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</P>
