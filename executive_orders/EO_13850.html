          <p id="p-3" data-page="55243">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:</p>

          <p id="p-8" data-page="55243">(b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="55244"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-55244" data-page="55244" data-text="Start Printed Page 55244" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 55244}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 55244</span></span></span>

          <p id="p-9" data-page="55244">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in subsection 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is therefore hereby suspended. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="55244">
            <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13692">Executive Order 13692,</a> and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="55244">
            <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include:</p>
          <p id="p-12" data-page="55244">(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</p>
          <p id="p-13" data-page="55244">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>
          <p id="p-14" data-page="55244">
            <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-15" data-page="55244">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-16" data-page="55244">
            <strong>Sec. 6</strong>. For the purposes of this order:</p>
          <p id="p-17" data-page="55244">(a) the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means an individual or entity;</p>
          <p id="p-18" data-page="55244">(b) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>
          <p id="p-19" data-page="55244">(c) the term &ldquo;United States person&rdquo; means any United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States;</p>
          <p id="p-20" data-page="55244">(d) the term &ldquo;Government of Venezuela&rdquo; means the Government of Venezuela, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of Venezuela, and any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Venezuela.</p>
          <p id="p-21" data-page="55244">
            <strong>Sec. 7</strong>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons or to the Government of Venezuela of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13692">Executive Order 13692,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>

The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All agencies of the United States Government shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
