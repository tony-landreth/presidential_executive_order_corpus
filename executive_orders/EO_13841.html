        <h1 id="h-1">Affording Congress an Opportunity To Address Family Separation</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="29435">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=8&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1101&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">8 U.S.C. 1101</a> <em>et seq.,</em> it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="29435">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> It is the policy of this Administration to rigorously enforce our immigration laws. Under our laws, the only legal way for an alien to enter this country is at a designated port of entry at an appropriate time. When an alien enters or attempts to enter the country anywhere else, that alien has committed at least the crime of improper entry and is subject to a fine or imprisonment under section 1325(a) of title 8, United States Code. This Administration will initiate proceedings to enforce this and other criminal provisions of the INA until and unless Congress directs otherwise. It is also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. It is unfortunate that Congress's failure to act and court orders have put the Administration in the position of separating alien families to effectively enforce the law.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="29435">

        <p id="p-16" data-page="29436">
          <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. <em>Prioritization of Immigration Proceedings Involving Alien Families.</em> The Attorney General shall, to the extent practicable, prioritize the adjudication of cases involving detained families.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="29436">
          <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. <em>General Provisions.</em> (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
