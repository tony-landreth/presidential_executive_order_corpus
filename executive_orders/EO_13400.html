        <p id="p-2" data-page="25483">I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States is posed by the persistence of violence in Sudan's Darfur region, particularly against civilians and including sexual violence against women and girls, and by the deterioration of the security situation and its negative impact on humanitarian assistance efforts, as noted by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1591 of March 29, 2005, and, to deal with that threat, hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13067">Executive Order 13067</a> of November 3, 1997, with respect to the policies and actions of the Government of Sudan, and hereby order:</p>

          <strong>Sec. 4.</strong> For those persons listed in or designated pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="25485"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-25485" data-page="25485" data-text="Start Printed Page 25485" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 25485}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 25485</span></span></span>would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that, for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13067">Executive Order 13067</a> and expanded by this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
