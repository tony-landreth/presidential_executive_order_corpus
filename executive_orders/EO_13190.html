        <h1 id="h-1">President's Commission on Educational Resource Equity</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="5424">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="5424">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em> Policy.</em> A quality education is essential to the success of every child in the 21st century and to the continued strength and prosperity of our Nation. Our Nation has embraced the goal of promoting high educational standards for all children and increasing accountability in education. Although we know it is crucial that all children have access to the educational resources and opportunity necessary to achieve high standards, long-standing gaps in access to educational resources exist, including disparities based on race and ethnicity. These gaps limit the ability of individuals, as well as our Nation, to reach their full potential. Therefore, it is the policy of this Administration that our Nation undertake appropriate steps to understand fully the current status of resource equity in education and to identify and implement strategies at the local, State, and national levels that will ensure that all students have a full and equal opportunity to succeed.</p>
