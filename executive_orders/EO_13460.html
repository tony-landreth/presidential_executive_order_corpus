          <h1 id="h-1">Blocking Property of Additional Persons in Connection With the National Emergency With Respect to Syria</h1>

          <p id="p-1" data-page="8991">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1701&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq</em>.)(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1601&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1601</a> <em>et seq</em>.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, </p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="8991">I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that the Government of Syria continues to engage in certain conduct that formed the basis for the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13338">Executive Order 13338</a> of May 11, 2004, including but not limited to undermining efforts with respect to the stabilization of Iraq. I further find that the conduct of certain members of the Government of Syria and other persons contributing to public corruption related to Syria, including by misusing Syrian public assets or by misusing public authority, entrenches and enriches the Government of Syria and its supporters and thereby enables the Government of Syria to continue to engage in certain conduct that formed the basis for the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13338">Executive Order 13338</a>. In light of these findings, and to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13338">Executive Order 13338</a> of May 11, 2004, I hereby order: </p>

            <strong>Sec. 3.</strong> (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="8992"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-8992" data-page="8992" data-text="Start Printed Page 8992" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 8992}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 8992</span></span></span>

            <strong>Sec. 4.</strong> For purposes of this order: </p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="8992">(a) the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means any individual or entity; </p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="8992">(b) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and </p>

            <strong>Sec. 5.</strong> I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of, persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13338">Executive Order 13338</a> and relied upon for additional steps taken in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13399">Executive Order 13399</a> of April 25, 2006, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order. </p>

            <strong>Sec. 6.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that, because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13338">Executive Order 13338</a> and relied upon for additional steps taken in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13399">Executive Order 13399,</a> there need be no prior notice of a determination made pursuant to this order. </p>

The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government, consistent with applicable law. All executive agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken. </p>
