        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13881">Executive Order 13881</a> of July 15, 2019
        <h1 id="h-1">Maximizing Use of American-Made Goods, Products, and Materials</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="34257">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to promote the principles underlying the Buy American Act of 1933 (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/8301?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">41 U.S.C. 8301</a>-8305), it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="34257">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy</em>. (a) As expressed in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13788">Executive Order 13788</a> of April 18, 2017 (Buy American and Hire American), and in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13858">Executive Order 13858</a> of January 31, 2019 (Strengthening Buy-American Preferences for Infrastructure Projects), it is the policy of the United States to buy American and to maximize, consistent with law, the use of goods, products, and materials produced in the United States. To those ends, my Administration shall enforce the Buy American Act to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="34257">(b) In Executive Order 10582 of December 17, 1954 (Prescribing Uniform Procedures for Certain Determinations Under the Buy-American Act), President Eisenhower established that materials shall be, for purposes of the Buy American Act, considered of foreign origin if the cost of the foreign products used in such materials constitutes 50 percent or more of the cost of all the products used in such materials. He also established that, in determining whether the bid or offered price of materials of domestic origin is unreasonable or inconsistent with the public interest, the executive agencies shall either (1) add 6 percent to the total bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin, or (2) add 10 percent to the total bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin less certain specified costs as follows. Where the foreign bid or offer is less than $25,000, applicable duty is excluded from the calculation. Where the foreign bid or offer is more than $25,000, both applicable duty, and all costs incurred after arrival in the United States, are excluded from the calculation.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="34257">(c) The policies described in section 1(b) of this order were adopted by the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), title 48, Code of Federal Regulations. The FAR should be reviewed and revised, as appropriate, to most effectively carry out the goals of the Buy American Act and my Administration's policy of enforcing the Buy American Act to its maximum lawful extent. I therefore direct the members of the FAR Council to consider measures that may better effectuate this policy.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Proposed Rules</em>. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the FAR Council shall consider proposing for notice and public comment:</p>
