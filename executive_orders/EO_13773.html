          <h1 id="h-1">Enforcing Federal Law With Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="10691">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="10691">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose.</em> Transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including transnational drug cartels, have spread throughout the Nation, threatening the safety of the United States and its citizens. These organizations derive revenue through widespread illegal conduct, including acts of violence and abuse that exhibit a wanton disregard for human life. They, for example, have been known to commit brutal murders, rapes, and other barbaric acts.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="10691">These groups are drivers of crime, corruption, violence, and misery. In particular, the trafficking by cartels of controlled substances has triggered a resurgence in deadly drug abuse and a corresponding rise in violent crime related to drugs. Likewise, the trafficking and smuggling of human beings by transnational criminal groups risks creating a humanitarian crisis. These crimes, along with many others, are enriching and empowering these organizations to the detriment of the American people.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="10691">A comprehensive and decisive approach is required to dismantle these organized crime syndicates and restore safety for the American people.</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="10691">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> It shall be the policy of the executive branch to:</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="10691">(a) strengthen enforcement of Federal law in order to thwart transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including criminal gangs, cartels, racketeering organizations, and other groups engaged in illicit activities that present a threat to public safety and national security and that are related to, for example:</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-7" data-page="10691">(i) the illegal smuggling and trafficking of humans, drugs or other substances, wildlife, and weapons;</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-8" data-page="10691">(ii) corruption, cybercrime, fraud, financial crimes, and intellectual-property theft; or</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-9" data-page="10691">(iii) the illegal concealment or transfer of proceeds derived from such illicit activities.</p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="10691">(b) ensure that Federal law enforcement agencies give a high priority and devote sufficient resources to efforts to identify, interdict, disrupt, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including through the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of members of such organizations, the extradition of members of such organizations to face justice in the United States and, where appropriate and to the extent permitted by law, the swift removal from the United States of foreign nationals who are members of such organizations;</p>

          <p id="p-11" data-page="10691">(c) maximize the extent to which all Federal agencies share information and coordinate with Federal law enforcement agencies, as permitted by law, in order to identify, interdict, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations;<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="10692"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-10692" data-page="10692" data-text="Start Printed Page 10692" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 10692}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 10692</span></span></span>
          </p>
          <p id="p-12" data-page="10692">(d) enhance cooperation with foreign counterparts against transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including, where appropriate and permitted by law, through sharing of intelligence and law enforcement information and through increased security sector assistance to foreign partners by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security;</p>
          <p id="p-13" data-page="10692">(e) develop strategies, under the guidance of the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to maximize coordination among agencies&mdash;such as through the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF), Special Operations Division, the OCDETF Fusion Center, and the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center&mdash;to counter the crimes described in subsection (a) of this section, consistent with applicable Federal law; and</p>
          <p id="p-14" data-page="10692">(f) pursue and support additional efforts to prevent the operational success of transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations within and beyond the United States, to include prosecution of ancillary criminal offenses, such as immigration fraud and visa fraud, and the seizure of the implements of such organizations and forfeiture of the proceeds of their criminal activity.</p>
