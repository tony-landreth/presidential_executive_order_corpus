          <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <E T="03">et seq</E>.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq</E>.), the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-61, as amended, 50 U.S.C. 1701 note), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in order to take additional steps with respect to the Government of Burma's continued repression of the democratic opposition in Burma, and with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13047 of May 20, 1997, relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13310 of July 28, 2003, and expanded in Executive Order 13448 of October 18, 2007, </FP>
          <FP>I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, hereby order: </FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Section 1.</E> Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), (3), and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)), the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (title IX, Public Law 106-387), or regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, all property and interests in property of the following persons that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States persons, including their overseas branches, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: </FP>
          <FP>(a) the persons listed in the Annex attached and made a part of this order; and </FP>
          <FP>(b) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State: </FP>
          <FP>(i) to be owned or controlled by, directly or indirectly, the Government of Burma or an official or officials of the Government of Burma; </FP>
          <FP>(ii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in support of, the Government of Burma, the State Peace and Development Council of Burma, the Union Solidarity and Development Association of Burma, any successor entity to any of the foregoing, any senior official of any of the foregoing, or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13310, Executive Order 13448, or this order; or </FP>
          <FP>(iii) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13310, Executive Order 13448, or this order. </FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 2.</E> (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. </FP>

          <FP>(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. <PRTPAGE P="24492"/>
          </FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 3.</E> For purposes of this order: </FP>
          <FP>(a) the term “person” means an individual or entity; </FP>
          <FP>(b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; </FP>
          <FP>(c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; and </FP>
          <FP>(d) the term “Government of Burma” means the Government of Burma (sometimes referred to as Myanmar), its agencies, instrumentalities and controlled entities, and the Central Bank of Burma. </FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 4.</E> I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of, persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13047, relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13310, and expanded in Executive Order 13448, and hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order. </FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 5.</E> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13047, relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13310, and expanded in Executive Order 13448, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order. </FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 6.</E> The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and section 4 of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order. </FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 7.</E> The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine, and to take necessary action to give effect to that determination, that circumstances no longer warrant the blocking of the property and interests in property of, or the prohibiting of transactions with, a person listed in the Annex to this order. </FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 8.</E> Nothing in this order is intended to affect the continued effectiveness of any rules, regulations, orders, licenses, or other forms of administrative action issued, taken, or continued in effect heretofore or hereafter under 31 C.F.R. chapter V, except as expressly terminated, modified, or suspended by or pursuant to this order. </FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 9.</E> This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or any other person. </FP>
