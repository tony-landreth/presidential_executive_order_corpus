I hereby order:</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="19283">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person (including any foreign branch) of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:</p>
          (i) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in, directly or indirectly, any of the following in or in relation to South Sudan:

          (ii) to be a leader of (A) an entity, including any government, rebel militia, or other group, that has, or whose members have, engaged in any of the activities described in subsection (a)(i) of this section or (B) an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order;

          (iv) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.
          <p id="p-16" data-page="19284">(b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided in this order and by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-17" data-page="19284">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with this national emergency, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.</p>

            <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not limited to:</p>
          <p id="p-19" data-page="19284">(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</p>
          <p id="p-20" data-page="19284">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>
          <p id="p-21" data-page="19284">
            <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p>
          <p id="p-22" data-page="19284">
            <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-23" data-page="19284">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-24" data-page="19284">
            <strong>Sec. 6</strong>. For the purposes of this order:</p>
          <p id="p-25" data-page="19284">(a) the term “person” means an individual or entity;</p>

          <p id="p-28" data-page="19284">
            <strong>Sec. 7</strong>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="19285"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-19285" data-page="19285" data-text="Start Printed Page 19285" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 19285}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 19285</span></span></span>I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing this national emergency, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>

            <strong>Sec. 8</strong>.
