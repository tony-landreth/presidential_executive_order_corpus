        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13503">Executive Order 13503</a> of February 19, 2009
        <h1 id="h-1">Establishment of the White House Office of Urban Affairs</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="8139">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to take a coordinated and comprehensive approach to developing and implementing an effective strategy concerning urban America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="8139">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em>Policy. </em> About 80 percent of Americans live in urban areas, and the economic health and social vitality of our urban communities are critically important to the prosperity and quality of life for Americans. Vibrant cities spawn innovation, economic growth, and cultural enrichment through the businesses, universities, and civic, cultural, religious, and nonprofit institutions they attract. Forward-looking policies that encourage wise investment and development in our urban areas will create employment and housing opportunities and make our country more competitive, prosperous, and strong. In the past, insufficient attention has been paid to the problems faced by urban areas and to coordinating the many Federal programs that affect our cities. A more comprehensive approach is needed, both to develop an effective strategy for urban America and to coordinate the actions of the many executive departments and agencies whose actions impact urban life.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 2.</strong>
