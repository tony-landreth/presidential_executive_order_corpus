        <h1 id="h-1">Creation of the White House Task Force on Drug Use in Sports and Authorization for the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy To Serve as the United States Government's Representative on the Board of the World Anti-Doping Agency</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="49469">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Office of National Drug Control Reauthorization Act of 1998, (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=21&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1701&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">21 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq</em>.), and in order to develop recommendations for Federal agency actions to address the use of drugs in sports, in particular among young people, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="49469">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em> Policy.</em> The use of drugs in sports has reached a level that endangers not just the legitimacy of athletic competition but also the lives and health of athletes—from the elite ranks to youth leagues. The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse issued in 1999 found that in just 1 year's time the rate of steroid use among young people rose roughly 50 percent among both sexes and across all age groups. It is the policy of my Administration to take the steps needed to help eliminate illicit or otherwise banned drug use and doping in sports at the State, national, and international level.</p>

        <p id="p-4" data-page="49469">(b) The Task Force shall develop recommendations for the President on further executive and legislative actions that can be undertaken to address the problem of doping and drug use in sports. In developing the recommendations, the Task Force shall consider, among other things: (i) the health and safety of America's athletes, in particular our Nation's young people; (ii) the integrity of honest athletic competition; and (iii) the views and recommendations of State and local governments, the private sector, citizens, community groups, and nonprofit organizations, on actions to address this threat. The Task Force, through its Chairs, shall submit its recommendations to the President.</p>
