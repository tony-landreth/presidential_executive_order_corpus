            <strong>Sec. 5.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="53839"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-53839" data-page="53839" data-text="Start Printed Page 53839" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 53839}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 53839</span></span></span>to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466</a> and expanded in scope in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1(a) of this order. </p>

The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law.  All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order. </p>
