          <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13917">Executive Order 13917</a> of April 28, 2020
          <h1 id="h-1">Delegating Authority Under the Defense Production Act With Respect to Food Supply Chain Resources During the National Emergency Caused by the Outbreak of COVID-19</h1>

          <p id="p-1" data-page="26313">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/4501?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 4501</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (the “Act”), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="26313">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> The 2019 novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing outbreaks of the disease COVID-19, has significantly disrupted the lives of Americans. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), I declared that the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constituted a national emergency, beginning March 1, 2020. Since then, the American people have united behind a policy of mitigation strategies, including social distancing, to flatten the curve of infections and reduce the spread of COVID-19. The COVID-19 outbreak and these necessary mitigation measures have taken a dramatic toll on the United States economy and critical infrastructure.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="26313">It is important that processors of beef, pork, and poultry (“meat and poultry”) in the food supply chain continue operating and fulfilling orders to ensure a continued supply of protein for Americans. However, outbreaks of COVID-19 among workers at some processing facilities have led to the reduction in some of those facilities' production capacity. In addition, recent actions in some States have led to the complete closure of some large processing facilities. Such actions may differ from or be inconsistent with interim guidance recently issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the Department of Labor entitled “Meat and Poultry Processing Workers and Employers” providing for the safe operation of such facilities.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="26313">Such closures threaten the continued functioning of the national meat and poultry supply chain, undermining critical infrastructure during the national emergency. Given the high volume of meat and poultry processed by many facilities, any unnecessary closures can quickly have a large effect on the food supply chain. For example, closure of a single large beef processing facility can result in the loss of over 10 million individual servings of beef in a single day. Similarly, under established supply chains, closure of a single meat or poultry processing facility can severely disrupt the supply of protein to an entire grocery store chain.</p>

          <p id="p-5" data-page="26313">Accordingly, I find that meat and poultry in the food supply chain meet the criteria specified in section 101(b) of the Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/4511?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 4511</a>(b)). Under the delegation of authority provided in this order, the Secretary of Agriculture shall take all appropriate action under that section to ensure that meat and poultry processors continue operations consistent with the guidance for their operations jointly issued by the CDC and OSHA. Under the delegation of authority provided in this order, the Secretary of Agriculture may identify additional specific food supply chain resources that meet the criteria of section 101(b).<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="26314"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-26314" data-page="26314" data-text="Start Printed Page 26314" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 26314}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 26314</span></span></span>

            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Ensuring the Continued Supply of Meat and Poultry.</em> (a) Notwithstanding <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13603">Executive Order 13603</a> of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resources Preparedness), the authority of the President to require performance of contracts or orders (other than contracts of employment) to promote the national defense over performance of any other contracts or orders, to allocate materials, services, and facilities as deemed necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense, and to implement the Act in subchapter III of chapter 55 of title 50, United States Code (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/4554?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 4554</a>, 4555, 4556, 4559, 4560), is delegated to the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to food supply chain resources, including meat and poultry, during the national emergency caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 within the United States.</p>
