        <h1 id="h-1">Blocking Property of Persons Threatening the Peace, Security, or Stability of Burma</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="41243">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1701&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1601&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1601</a> <em>et seq.</em>), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=8&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1182&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">8 U.S.C. 1182</a>(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="41243">I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, hereby modify the scope of the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13047">Executive Order 13047</a> of May 20, 1997, as modified in scope in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13448">Executive Order 13448</a> of October 18, 2007, and relied upon for additional steps taken in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13310">Executive Order 13310</a> of July 28, 2003, <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13448">Executive Order 13448</a> of October 18, 2007, and <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13464">Executive Order 13464</a> of April 30, 2008. The Government of Burma has made progress towards political reform in a number of areas, including by releasing hundreds of political prisoners, pursuing ceasefire talks with several armed ethnic groups, and pursuing a substantive dialogue with the democratic opposition. Recognizing that such reform is fragile, I hereby find that the continued detention of political prisoners, efforts to undermine or obstruct the political reform process, efforts to undermine or obstruct the peace process with ethnic minorities, military trade with North Korea, and human rights abuses in Burma particularly in ethnic areas, effectuated by persons within or outside the Government of Burma, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Accordingly, I hereby order:</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="41243">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong> (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, including any foreign branch, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with or at the recommendation of the Secretary of State:</p>
        (i) to have engaged in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the peace, security, or stability of Burma, such as actions that have the purpose or effect of undermining or obstructing the political reform process or the peace process with ethnic minorities in Burma;
        (ii) to be responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, or to have participated in, the commission of human rights abuses in Burma;
        (iii) to have, directly or indirectly, imported, exported, reexported, sold or supplied arms or related materiel from North Korea or the Government of North Korea to Burma or the Government of Burma;
        (iv) to be a senior official of an entity that has engaged in the acts described in subsection (a)(i)-(iii) of this section;

        (v) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, the acts described in subsection (a)(i)-(iii) of this section or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or<span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-41244" data-page="41244" data-text="Start Printed Page 41244" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 41244}'> </span></span>

        <p id="p-11" data-page="41244">
          <strong>Sec. 2.</strong> I hereby amend: (a) <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13464">Executive Order 13464</a> of April 30, 2008, by removing “logistical, or technical” in section 1(b)(ii) and replacing it with “or technological”; and</p>

          <strong>Sec. 3.</strong> I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13047">Executive Order 13047,</a> as modified in scope in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13448">Executive Order 13448</a> and in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.</p>

        <p id="p-15" data-page="41244">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="41244">
          <strong>Sec. 5.</strong> I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in subsection 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p>

        <p id="p-18" data-page="41244">
          <strong>Sec. 7.</strong> (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="41244">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="41244">
          <strong>Sec. 8.</strong> For the purposes of this order: (a) the term “person” means an individual or entity;</p>
        <p id="p-21" data-page="41244">(b) The term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and</p>

I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13047">Executive Order 13047,</a> as modified in scope in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13448">Executive Order 13448</a> and in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 10.</strong> The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 11.</strong> This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
