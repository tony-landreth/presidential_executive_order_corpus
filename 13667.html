          <p id="p-2" data-page="28387">I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the situation in and in relation to the Central African Republic, which has been marked by a breakdown of law and order, intersectarian tension, widespread violence and atrocities, and the pervasive, often forced recruitment and use of child soldiers, which threatens the peace, security, or stability of the Central African Republic and neighboring states, and which was addressed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 2121 of October 10, 2013, Resolution 2127 of December 5, 2013, and Resolution 2134 of January 28, 2014, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.

          (E) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.
          <p id="p-19" data-page="28388">(b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order.</p>

            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>.

          <p id="p-21" data-page="28388">
            <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not limited to:</p>
          <p id="p-22" data-page="28388">(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</p>

          <p id="p-24" data-page="28388">
            <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p>

            <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="28389"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-28389" data-page="28389" data-text="Start Printed Page 28389" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 28389}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 28389</span></span></span>

          <p id="p-27" data-page="28389">
            <strong>Sec. 6</strong>. For the purposes of this order:</p>
          <p id="p-28" data-page="28389">(a) the term “person” means an individual or entity;</p>
          <p id="p-29" data-page="28389">(b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and</p>
          <p id="p-30" data-page="28389">(c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.</p>
          <p id="p-31" data-page="28389">
            <strong>Sec. 7</strong>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-32" data-page="28389">
            <strong>Sec. 8</strong>.

The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-33" data-page="28389">
            <strong>Sec. 9</strong>. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine that circumstances no longer warrant the blocking of the property and interests in property of a person listed in the Annex to this order, and to take necessary action to give effect to that determination.</p>
          <p id="p-34" data-page="28389">
