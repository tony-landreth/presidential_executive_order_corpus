        <h1 id="h-1">Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Nicaragua</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="61505">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1701&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1601&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1601</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (NEA), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=8&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1182&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">8 U.S.C. 1182</a>(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="61505">I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the situation in Nicaragua, including the violent response by the Government of Nicaragua to the protests that began on April 18, 2018, and the Ortega regime's systematic dismantling and undermining of democratic institutions and the rule of law, its use of indiscriminate violence and repressive tactics against civilians, as well as its corruption leading to the destabilization of Nicaragua's economy, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. I hereby determine and order:</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="61505">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>.

        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-4" data-page="61505">(i) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, any of the following:</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="61505">(A) serious human rights abuse in Nicaragua;</p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="61505">(B) actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Nicaragua;</p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="61505">(C) actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Nicaragua;</p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="61505">(D) any transaction or series of transactions involving deceptive practices or corruption by, on behalf of, or otherwise related to the Government of Nicaragua or a current or former official of the Government of Nicaragua, such as the misappropriation of public assets or expropriation of private assets for personal gain or political purposes, corruption related to government contracts, or bribery;</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-9" data-page="61505">(ii) to be a leader or official of an entity that has, or whose members have, engaged in any activity described in subsection (a)(i) of this section or of an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order;</p>

        </p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="61506">(B) any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-14" data-page="61506">(v) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="61506">(b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1 of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except where the Secretary of State determines that the person's entry is in the national interest of the United States. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="61506">
          <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="61506">
          <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include:</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="61506">(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="61506">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>
        <p id="p-21" data-page="61506">
          <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-22" data-page="61506">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-23" data-page="61506">
          <strong>Sec. 6</strong>. For the purposes of this order:</p>
        <p id="p-24" data-page="61506">(a) the term “person” means an individual or entity;</p>
        <p id="p-25" data-page="61506">(b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>
        <p id="p-26" data-page="61506">(c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; and</p>
        <p id="p-27" data-page="61506">(d) the term “Government of Nicaragua” means the Government of Nicaragua, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of Nicaragua, and any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Nicaragua.</p>
        <p id="p-28" data-page="61506">
          <strong>Sec. 7</strong>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="61507"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-61507" data-page="61507" data-text="Start Printed Page 61507" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 61507}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 61507</span></span></span>

          <strong>Sec. 8</strong>.
