        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13630">Executive Order 13630</a> of December 6, 2012
        <h1 id="h-1">Establishment of an Interagency Task Force on Commercial Advocacy</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="73893">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to help level the playing field on behalf of U.S. businesses and workers competing for international contracts against foreign firms and to facilitate the growth of sales of U.S. goods and services around the world in support of the National Export Initiative, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="73893">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13534">Executive Order 13534</a> of March 11, 2010, created the National Export Initiative (NEI), which provides unprecedented Federal support for exports of goods and services by American businesses. <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13534">Executive Order 13534</a> also established the Export Promotion Cabinet to develop and coordinate the implementation of the eight priorities of the NEI, which include, but are not limited to, improving advocacy and trade promotion efforts on behalf of U.S. exporters, increasing access to export financing, and removing barriers to trade and enforcing U.S. trade laws and agreements. As part of these responsibilities, the Export Promotion Cabinet, in coordination with the Advocacy Center at the Department of Commerce, is focused on ensuring that the Federal Government's commercial advocacy effectively promotes exports by U.S. businesses, particularly by those firms competing for international contracts against foreign firms that may benefit from strong home government support. The creation of a new whole-of-government commercial advocacy task force that will provide enhanced Federal support for U.S. businesses competing for international contracts, coordinate the efforts of executive branch leadership in engaging their foreign counterparts on commercial advocacy issues, and increase the availability of information to the U.S. business community about these kinds of export opportunities, will ensure that U.S. exporters have more support for selling their goods and services in global markets.</p>
