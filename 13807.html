          <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13807">Executive Order 13807</a> of August 15, 2017
          <h1 id="h-1">Establishing Discipline and Accountability in the Environmental Review and Permitting Process for Infrastructure Projects</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="40463">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure that the Federal environmental review and permitting process for infrastructure projects is coordinated, predictable, and transparent, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="40463">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose.</em> America needs increased infrastructure investment to strengthen our economy, enhance our competitiveness in world trade, create jobs and increase wages for our workers, and reduce the costs of goods and services for our families. The poor condition of America's infrastructure has been estimated to cost a typical American household thousands of dollars each year. Inefficiencies in current infrastructure project decisions, including management of environmental reviews and permit decisions or authorizations, have delayed infrastructure investments, increased project costs, and blocked the American people from enjoying improved infrastructure that would benefit our economy, society, and environment. More efficient and effective Federal infrastructure decisions can transform our economy, so the Federal Government, as a whole, must change the way it processes environmental reviews and authorization decisions.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="40463">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> It is the policy of the Federal Government to:</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="40463">(a) safeguard our communities and maintain a healthy environment;</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="40463">(b) ensure that Federal authorities make informed decisions concerning the environmental impacts of infrastructure projects;</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="40463">(c) develop infrastructure in an environmentally sensitive manner;</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="40463">(d) provide transparency and accountability to the public regarding environmental review and authorization decisions;</p>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="40463">(e) be good stewards of public funds, including those used to develop infrastructure projects, and avoid duplicative and wasteful processes;</p>
          <p id="p-9" data-page="40463">(f) conduct environmental reviews and authorization processes in a coordinated, consistent, predictable, and timely manner in order to give public and private investors the confidence necessary to make funding decisions for new infrastructure projects;</p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="40463">(g) speak with a coordinated voice when conducting environmental reviews and making authorization decisions; and</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="40463">(h) make timely decisions with the goal of completing all Federal environmental reviews and authorization decisions for major infrastructure projects within 2 years.</p>
          <p id="p-12" data-page="40463">
            <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. <em>Definitions.</em> The terms of this order shall be applied consistently with those defined under <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=42&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=4370&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">42 U.S.C. 4370</a>m and implementing guidance to the maximum extent possible.

          <p id="p-19" data-page="40464">
            <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. <em>Agency Performance Accountability.</em> Federal agencies should follow transparent and coordinated processes for conducting environmental reviews and making authorization decisions. These processes must include early and open coordination among Federal, State, tribal, and local agencies and early engagement with the public. Holding Federal agencies accountable for their progress on implementing the policy set forth in section 2 of this order should, among other things, produce measurably better environmental outcomes with respect to infrastructure development.</p>
          <p id="p-20" data-page="40464">(a) <em>Performance Priority Goals.</em>
          </p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-21" data-page="40464">(i) <em>CAP Goal.</em> A CAP Goal is a Federal tool for accelerating progress in priority areas that require active collaboration among multiple agencies to overcome organizational barriers and to achieve better performance than one agency could achieve on its own. Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the FPISC, shall establish a CAP Goal on Infrastructure Permitting Modernization so that, where permitted by law:</p>
          <p id="p-22" data-page="40464">(A) Federal environmental reviews and authorization processes for infrastructure projects are consistent, coordinated, and predictable; and</p>

          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-24" data-page="40464">(ii) <em>Agency Goals.</em> All Federal agencies with environmental review, authorization, or consultation responsibilities for infrastructure projects shall modify their Strategic Plans and Annual Performance Plans under the <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="40465"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-40465" data-page="40465" data-text="Start Printed Page 40465" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 40465}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 40465</span></span></span>GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 to include agency performance goals related to the completion of environmental reviews and authorizations for infrastructure projects consistent with the new CAP Goal on Infrastructure Permitting Modernization. The agencies shall integrate the achievement of these performance goals into appropriate agency personnel performance plans, such as those of the agency Chief Environmental Review and Permitting Officers (CERPOs) or other appropriate officials, consistent with guidance to be provided by OMB, in consultation with the Office of Personnel Management. Progress on these goals shall be reviewed and analyzed by agency leadership, pursuant to the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010.</p>
          <p id="p-25" data-page="40465">(b) <em>Accountability.</em> Within 180 days of the establishment of the CAP Goal on Infrastructure Permitting Modernization, as described in subsection (a) of this section, or such longer period of time as determined by the Director of OMB, OMB, in consultation with the FPISC, shall issue guidance for establishing a performance accountability system to facilitate achievement of the CAP Goal.</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-26" data-page="40465">(i) <em>Tracking of Major Infrastructure Projects.</em> The performance accountability system shall track each major infrastructure project. The performance accountability system shall include, at a minimum, assessments of the agency's performance with respect to each of the following areas, as applicable:</p>
          <p id="p-27" data-page="40465">(A) whether major infrastructure projects are processed using the “One Federal Decision” mechanism, as described in subsection 5(b) of this order;</p>
          <p id="p-28" data-page="40465">(B) whether major infrastructure projects have a permitting timetable;</p>
          <p id="p-29" data-page="40465">(C) whether major infrastructure projects follow an effective process that automatically elevates instances in which permitting timetable milestones are missed or extended, or are anticipated to be missed or extended, to appropriate senior agency officials;</p>
          <p id="p-30" data-page="40465">(D) whether agencies are meeting the established milestones in the permitting timetable;</p>

          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-33" data-page="40465">(ii) <em>Scoring.</em> The accountability system shall include a scoring mechanism that shall follow, at a minimum, the following procedures:</p>
          <p id="p-34" data-page="40465">(A) agencies will submit information to OMB, consistent with existing reporting mechanisms to the maximum extent possible, on the assessment areas described in subsection (b)(i) of this section;</p>
          <p id="p-35" data-page="40465">(B) at least once per quarter, OMB will produce a scorecard of agency performance and overall progress toward achieving CAP Goal targets;</p>
          <p id="p-36" data-page="40465">(C) where an agency's inability to meet a permitting timetable milestone results in a significant delay of the project timeline, after consulting with the project sponsor and relevant agencies, agencies will submit (based on OMB guidance) an estimate of the delay's costs to the project; and</p>
          <p id="p-37" data-page="40465">(D) the Director of OMB will consider each agency's performance during budget formulation and determine whether appropriate penalties, including those authorized at <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=23&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=139&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">23 U.S.C. 139</a>(h)(7) and <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=33&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=2348&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">33 U.S.C. 2348</a>(h)(5), must or should be imposed, to the extent required or permitted by law, for those that significantly fail to meet a permitting timetable milestone or in other situations deemed appropriate by the Director of OMB after considering the causes of any poor performance.</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-38" data-page="40465">(iii) <em>Best Practices.</em> Agencies shall implement the techniques and strategies the FPISC annually identifies as best practices pursuant to <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=42&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=4370&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">42 U.S.C. 4370</a>m-1(c)(2)(B), as appropriate.

          <p id="p-39" data-page="40466">
            <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. <em>Process Enhancements.</em> In furtherance of the policy described in section 2 of this order, Federal agencies shall follow a more unified environmental review and authorization process.</p>
          <p id="p-40" data-page="40466">(a) <em>Processing of Major Infrastructure Projects.</em> In processing environmental reviews and authorizations for major infrastructure projects, Federal agencies shall:</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-41" data-page="40466">(i) use “One Federal Decision” described in subsection (b) of this section;</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-42" data-page="40466">(ii) develop and follow a permitting timetable, which shall be reviewed and updated at least quarterly by the lead Federal agency in consultation with Federal cooperating and participating agencies; and</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-43" data-page="40466">(iii) follow an effective process that automatically elevates instances where a permitting timetable milestone is missed or extended, or is anticipated to be missed or extended, to appropriate senior agency officials of the lead Federal agency and the cooperating and participating Federal agency or agencies to which the milestone applies.</p>
          <p id="p-44" data-page="40466">(b) <em>One Federal Decision.</em>
          </p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-45" data-page="40466">(i) Each major infrastructure project shall have a lead Federal agency, which shall be responsible for navigating the project through the Federal environmental review and authorization process, including the identification of a primary Federal point of contact at each Federal agency. All Federal cooperating and participating agencies shall identify points of contact for each project, cooperate with the lead Federal agency point of contact, and respond to all reasonable requests for information from the lead Federal agency in a timely manner.</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-46" data-page="40466">(ii) With respect to the applicability of NEPA to a major infrastructure project, the Federal lead, cooperating, and participating agencies for each major infrastructure project shall all record any individual agency decision in one Record of Decision (ROD), which shall be coordinated by the lead Federal agency unless the project sponsor requests that agencies issue separate NEPA documents, the NEPA obligations of a cooperating or participating agency have already been satisfied, or the lead Federal agency determines that a single ROD would not best promote completion of the project's environmental review and authorization process. The Federal lead, cooperating, and participating agencies shall all agree to a permitting timetable that includes the completion dates for the ROD and the federally required authorizations for the project.</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-47" data-page="40466">(iii) All Federal authorization decisions for the construction of a major infrastructure project shall be completed within 90 days of the issuance of a ROD by the lead Federal agency, provided that the final EIS includes an adequate level of detail to inform agency decisions pursuant to their specific statutory authority and requirements. The lead Federal agency may extend the 90-day deadline if the lead Federal agency determines that Federal law prohibits the agency from issuing its approval or permit within the 90-day period, the project sponsor requests that the permit or approval follow a different timeline, or the lead Federal agency determines that an extension would better promote completion of the project's environmental review and authorization process.</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-48" data-page="40466">(iv) The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and OMB shall develop the framework for implementing One Federal Decision, in consultation with the FPISC.</p>

          <p id="p-49" data-page="40466">(A) The framework should be consistent with the model processes established under <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=42&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=4370&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">42 U.S.C. 4370</a>m-2, <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=23&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=139&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">23 U.S.C. 139</a>, <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=33&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=2348&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">33 U.S.C. 2348</a>, the 2015 “Red Book” (officially entitled “Synchronizing Environmental Reviews for Transportation and Other Infrastructure Projects”), and CEQ guidance on efficient and timely environmental reviews under NEPA.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="40467"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-40467" data-page="40467" data-text="Start Printed Page 40467" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 40467}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 40467</span></span></span>

          <p id="p-50" data-page="40467">(B) The framework shall also include guidance on the development of permitting timetables by the lead Federal agencies, in collaboration with Federal cooperating and participating agencies. Permitting timetables shall identify estimated intermediate and final completion dates for all environmental reviews and authorizations that are reasonably anticipated as being needed for a project, including the process for granting extensions of any established dates. The guidance shall specify that lead Federal agencies need not include the estimated intermediate and final completion dates of any such reviews or authorizations until the design of a project has sufficiently advanced so that they can be developed. In such cases, the guidance shall instruct lead Federal agencies to estimate when the project's design will be advanced enough to determine such dates. The timelines shall account for any federally required decisions or permits that are assumed by, or delegated to, State, tribal, or local agencies and the extent to which any approval or permit to be issued by a Federal agency is dependent upon the issuance of such a decision or permit.</p>
          <p id="p-51" data-page="40467">(C) CEQ and OMB shall also develop guidance for applying One Federal Decision whenever the lead agency is a State, tribal, or local agency exercising an assignment or delegation of an agency's NEPA responsibilities.</p>
