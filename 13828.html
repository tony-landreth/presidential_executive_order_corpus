        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13828">Executive Order 13828</a> of April 10, 2018
        <h1 id="h-1">Reducing Poverty in America by Promoting Opportunity and Economic Mobility</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="15941">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to promote economic mobility, strong social networks, and accountability to American taxpayers, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="15941">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose</em>. The United States and its Constitution were founded on the principles of freedom and equal opportunity for all. To ensure that all Americans would be able to realize the benefits of those principles, especially during hard times, the Government established programs to help families with basic unmet needs. Unfortunately, many of the programs designed to help families have instead delayed economic independence, perpetuated poverty, and weakened family bonds. While bipartisan welfare reform enacted in 1996 was a step toward eliminating the economic stagnation and social harm that can result from long-term Government dependence, the welfare system still traps many recipients, especially children, in poverty and is in need of further reform and modernization in order to increase self-sufficiency, well-being, and economic mobility.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="15941">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Policy</em>. (a) In 2017, the Federal Government spent more than $700 billion on low-income assistance. Since its inception, the welfare system has grown into a large bureaucracy that might be susceptible to measuring success by how many people are enrolled in a program rather than by how many have moved from poverty into financial independence. This is not the type of system that was envisioned when welfare programs were instituted in this country. The Federal Government's role is to clear paths to self-sufficiency, reserving public assistance programs for those who are truly in need. The Federal Government should do everything within its authority to empower individuals by providing opportunities for work, including by investing in Federal programs that are effective at moving people into the workforce and out of poverty. It must examine Federal policies and programs to ensure that they are consistent with principles that are central to the American spirit—work, free enterprise, and safeguarding human and economic resources. For those policies or programs that are not succeeding in those respects, it is our duty to either improve or eliminate them.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="15941">(b) It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to reform the welfare system of the United States so that it empowers people in a manner that is consistent with applicable law and the following principles, which shall be known as the Principles of Economic Mobility:</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-5" data-page="15941">(i) Improve employment outcomes and economic independence (including by strengthening existing work requirements for work-capable people and introducing new work requirements when legally permissible);</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-6" data-page="15941">(ii) Promote strong social networks as a way of sustainably escaping poverty (including through work and marriage);</p>

        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-7" data-page="15941">(iii) Address the challenges of populations that may particularly struggle to find and maintain employment (including single parents, formerly incarcerated individuals, the homeless, substance abusers, individuals with disabilities, and disconnected youth);<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="15942"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-15942" data-page="15942" data-text="Start Printed Page 15942" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 15942}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 15942</span></span></span>
        </p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-8" data-page="15942">(iv) Balance flexibility and accountability both to ensure that State, local, and tribal governments, and other institutions, may tailor their public assistance programs to the unique needs of their communities and to ensure that welfare services and administering agencies can be held accountable for achieving outcomes (including by designing and tracking measures that assess whether programs help people escape poverty);</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-9" data-page="15942">(v) Reduce the size of bureaucracy and streamline services to promote the effective use of resources;</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-10" data-page="15942">(vi) Reserve benefits for people with low incomes and limited assets;</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-11" data-page="15942">(vii) Reduce wasteful spending by consolidating or eliminating Federal programs that are duplicative or ineffective;</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-12" data-page="15942">(viii) Create a system by which the Federal Government remains updated on State, local, and tribal successes and failures, and facilitates access to that information so that other States and localities can benefit from it; and</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-13" data-page="15942">(ix) Empower the private sector, as well as local communities, to develop and apply locally based solutions to poverty.</p>
        <p id="p-14" data-page="15942">(c) As part of our pledge to increase opportunities for those in need, the Federal Government must first enforce work requirements that are required by law. It must also strengthen requirements that promote obtaining and maintaining employment in order to move people to independence. To support this focus on employment, the Federal Government should:</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-15" data-page="15942">(i) review current federally funded workforce development programs. If more than one executive department or agency (agency) administers programs that are similar in scope or population served, they should be consolidated, to the extent permitted by law, into the agency that is best equipped to fulfill the expectations of the programs, while ineffective programs should be eliminated; and</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-16" data-page="15942">(ii) invest in effective workforce development programs and encourage, to the greatest extent possible, entities that have demonstrated success in equipping participants with skills necessary to obtain employment that enables them to financially support themselves and their families in today's economy.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="15942">(d) It is imperative to empower State, local, and tribal governments and private-sector entities to effectively administer and manage public assistance programs. Federal policies should allow local entities to develop and implement programs and strategies that are best for their respective communities. Specifically, policies should allow the private sector, including community and faith-based organizations, to create solutions that alleviate the need for welfare assistance, promote personal responsibility, and reduce reliance on government intervention and resources.</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-18" data-page="15942">(i) To promote the proper scope and functioning of government, the Federal Government must afford State, local, and tribal governments the freedom to design and implement programs that better allocate limited resources to meet different community needs.</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-19" data-page="15942">(ii) States and localities can use such flexibility to devise and evaluate innovative programs that serve diverse populations and families. States and localities can also model their own initiatives on the successful programs of others. To achieve the right balance, Federal leaders must continue to discuss opportunities to improve public assistance programs with State and local leaders, including our Nation's governors.</p>

        <p id="p-20" data-page="15942">(e) The Federal Government owes it to Americans to use taxpayer dollars for their intended purposes. Relevant agencies should establish clear metrics that measure outcomes so that agencies administering public assistance programs can be held accountable. These metrics should include assessments of whether programs help individuals and families find employment, increase earnings, escape poverty, and avoid long-term dependence. Whenever possible, agencies should harmonize their metrics to facilitate easier cross-<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="15943"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-15943" data-page="15943" data-text="Start Printed Page 15943" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 15943}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 15943</span></span></span>programmatic comparisons and to encourage further integration of service delivery at the local level. Agencies should also adopt policies to ensure that only eligible persons receive benefits and enforce all relevant laws providing that aliens who are not otherwise qualified and eligible may not receive benefits.</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-21" data-page="15943">(i) All entities that receive funds should be required to guarantee the integrity of the programs they administer. Technology and innovation should drive initiatives that increase program integrity and reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in the current system.</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-22" data-page="15943">(ii) The Federal Government must support State, local, and tribal partners by investing in tools to combat payment errors and verify eligibility for program participants. It must also work alongside public and private partners to assist recipients of welfare assistance to maximize access to services and benefits that support paths to self-sufficiency.</p>
