All agencies of the United States Government shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-18" data-page="41156">
            <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. For those persons whose property or interests in property are affected by this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13692">Executive Order 13692,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to this order.</p>
