        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13609">Executive Order 13609</a> of May 1, 2012
        <h1 id="h-1">Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="26413">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote international regulatory cooperation, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="26413">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em>Policy.</em> <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13563">Executive Order 13563</a> of January 18, 2011 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), states that our regulatory system must protect public health, welfare, safety, and our environment while promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation. In an increasingly global economy, international regulatory cooperation, consistent with domestic law and prerogatives and U.S. trade policy, can be an important means of promoting the goals of <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13563">Executive Order 13563</a>.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="26413">The regulatory approaches taken by foreign governments may differ from those taken by U.S. regulatory agencies to address similar issues. In some cases, the differences between the regulatory approaches of U.S. agencies and those of their foreign counterparts might not be necessary and might impair the ability of American businesses to export and compete internationally. In meeting shared challenges involving health, safety, labor, security, environmental, and other issues, international regulatory cooperation can identify approaches that are at least as protective as those that are or would be adopted in the absence of such cooperation. International regulatory cooperation can also reduce, eliminate, or prevent unnecessary differences in regulatory requirements.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 2.</strong>
          <em>Coordination of International Regulatory Cooperation.</em> (a) The Regulatory Working Group (Working Group) established by Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), which was reaffirmed by <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13563">Executive Order 13563,</a> shall, as appropriate:</p>
        (i) serve as a forum to discuss, coordinate, and develop a common understanding among agencies of U.S. Government positions and priorities with respect to:
        <p id="p-6" data-page="26413">(A) international regulatory cooperation activities that are reasonably anticipated to lead to significant regulatory actions;</p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="26413">(B) efforts across the Federal Government to support significant, cross-cutting international regulatory cooperation activities, such as the work of regulatory cooperation councils; and</p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="26413">(C) the promotion of good regulatory practices internationally, as well as the promotion of U.S. regulatory approaches, as appropriate; and</p>
        (ii) examine, among other things:
        <p id="p-10" data-page="26413">(A) appropriate strategies for engaging in the development of regulatory approaches through international regulatory cooperation, particularly in emerging technology areas, when consistent with section 1 of this order;</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="26413">(B) best practices for international regulatory cooperation with respect to regulatory development, and, where appropriate, information exchange and other regulatory tools; and</p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="26413">(C) factors that agencies should take into account when determining whether and how to consider other regulatory approaches under section 3(d) of this order.</p>

        <p id="p-13" data-page="26413">(b) As Chair of the Working Group, the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of Management <span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-26414" data-page="26414" data-text="Start Printed Page 26414" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 26414}'> </span></span>and Budget (OMB) shall convene the Working Group as necessary to discuss international regulatory cooperation issues as described above, and the Working Group shall include a representative from the Office of the United States Trade Representative and, as appropriate, representatives from other agencies and offices.</p>
        <p id="p-14" data-page="26414">(c) The activities of the Working Group, consistent with law, shall not duplicate the efforts of existing interagency bodies and coordination mechanisms. The Working Group shall consult with existing interagency bodies when appropriate.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="26414">(d) To inform its discussions, and pursuant to section 4 of Executive Order 12866, the Working Group may commission analytical reports and studies by OIRA, the Administrative Conference of the United States, or any other relevant agency, and the Administrator of OIRA may solicit input, from time to time, from representatives of business, nongovernmental organizations, and the public.</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="26414">(e) The Working Group shall develop and issue guidelines on the applicability and implementation of sections 2 through 4 of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="26414">(f) For purposes of this order, the Working Group shall operate by consensus.</p>

        <p id="p-19" data-page="26414">(a) if required to submit a Regulatory Plan pursuant to Executive Order 12866, include in that plan a summary of its international regulatory cooperation activities that are reasonably anticipated to lead to significant regulations, with an explanation of how these activities advance the purposes of <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13563">Executive Order 13563</a> and this order;</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="26414">(b) ensure that significant regulations that the agency identifies as having significant international impacts are designated as such in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, on RegInfo.gov, and on Regulations.gov;</p>
        <p id="p-21" data-page="26414">(c) in selecting which regulations to include in its retrospective review plan, as required by <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13563">Executive Order 13563,</a> consider:</p>
        (i) reforms to existing significant regulations that address unnecessary differences in regulatory requirements between the United States and its major trading partners, consistent with section 1 of this order, when stakeholders provide adequate information to the agency establishing that the differences are unnecessary; and
        
        (ii) such reforms in other circumstances as the agency deems appropriate; and
        
        <p id="p-24" data-page="26414">(d) for significant regulations that the agency identifies as having significant international impacts, consider, to the extent feasible, appropriate, and consistent with law, any regulatory approaches by a foreign government that the United States has agreed to consider under a regulatory cooperation council work plan.</p>
